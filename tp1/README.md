- Exercise 1

This exercise provided a dive into the practical aspects of shape rendering and manipulation within a 3D environment. Creating the MyTriangle and MyParallelogram classes was a foundational exercise in understanding the mathematical constructs behind computer graphics and the translation of these constructs into visual elements on the screen.

Through the process of defining vertices and ensuring the correct display of the parallelogram as double-sided, we gained a deeper understanding of how graphics APIs like WebGL handle rendering. It became clear that the visibility of an object in a 3D space is determined by more than just the shape's coordinates; it's also a function of the rendering pipeline's capacity to interpret these coordinates correctly.

Adjusting the vertex winding and experimenting with different indexing strategies led to a more nuanced appreciation for the complexities involved in rendering 2D shapes within a 3D context.

The integration of GUI elements to control the visibility of the graphics objects illustrated the dynamic nature of computer graphics. It reinforced the importance of creating interactive and flexible graphics applications that respond to user input in real-time.
This exercise stimulated a thoughtful approach to 3D rendering, from the creation of basic shapes to the implementation of user controls that manipulate the scene.


- Exercise 2

In this exercise, we were asked to create two additional shapes: a smaller triangle (MyTriangleSmall) and a larger triangle (MyTriangleBig). It helped us grasp the concepts of proportionality and scaling within a digital canvas, by forcing us to understand how objects of different scales 
coexist within the same scene.
